# CNN---Based-Leukemia-detection-and-classification
Leukemia is a heterogeneous category of blood malignancies that can be difficult to diagnose and classify because of its many subtypes and intricate morphological differences. In medical image processing, deep learning methods—most notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—have demonstrated potential. The classification of leukemia and its subtypes from peripheral blood smear pictures is proposed in this paper using a CNN-based framework. Our method distinguishes between leukemia cell types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), by utilizing hierarchical characteristics that are trained by CNNs. We assess our model using measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score after training it on a sizable, annotated dataset. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, surpassing that of conventional methods and indicating potential for improving clinical decision assistance.
